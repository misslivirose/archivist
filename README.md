# [WIP] Archivist

A tool for analyzing your past via Facebook archives. Work in progress. Upload a .zip folder archive from Facebook, and archivist will display every message you've ever sent or received. What could possibly go wrong with this information? 

You can also search through messages, but to be honest, I'm not sure how good the search capability is.
